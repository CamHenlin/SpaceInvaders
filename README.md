# SpaceInvaders

An Internet Explorer 6 compatible Space Invaders. Playable (here)[http://henlin.org/SpaceInvaders/SpaceInvaders.htm].

### Why?

Actually, sort of a funny story.

I originally wrote the SpaceInvaders clone in September of 2008, during breaks at work serving as a Systems Analyst in the Marine Corps. I pretty much got it to the point where the first level sort of "worked" and people around the office would sort of "race" to see who could beat the one level first. It was sort of fun, but everyone eventually forgot about it, and the computer I wrote it on was eventually replaced, and with it I figured I had lost the code.

However! Today (March 25, 2015) I got the idea of doing a search for "SpaceInvaders" in my gmail account. The first result was astounding! There were all of the image files and the blocked (by DoD email servers! *Thanks* NMCI!) HTML file for the game. I had tried emailing it to myself. Nice! I didn't see another email though. But I figured that I probably would have tried harder than that if I wanted to email myself the files.

So I manually went back to that date. I had sent myself another file moments later! The name of the file was Untitled.GIF, and it wouldn't open in Preview.app. I changed the file extension to a .ZIP, and it opened right away. There was my crappy Space Invaders clone! And it played just as well in modern Safari as it did in Internet Explorer 6 about 7 years ago! So I figured I'd toss it up on GitHub so I wouldn't risk losing it again. I left all of the original bad and strange code in place, and I would not recommend basing future projects on this code.
